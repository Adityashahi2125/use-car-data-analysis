Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive and professionally structured analysis of the used car market using modern data analytics practices. The primary goal is to extract actionable insights from structured automobile data by applying systematic data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques.

The repository is designed to reflect industry expectations for Data Science and Analytics roles, emphasizing analytical clarity, methodological rigor, and business relevance. It demonstrates the ability to translate raw data into meaningful insights that can support strategic decision‑making.

Project Objectives

Conduct end‑to‑end data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality

Analyze pricing behavior and resale trends across different vehicle attributes

Identify key variables influencing resale value, such as age, mileage, brand, fuel type, and ownership

Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns and relationships

Present findings using clear, professional visualizations suitable for business interpretation

Analytical Methodology

The analysis follows a structured and repeatable workflow:

Initial data inspection and validation

Handling missing values and inconsistent records

Feature‑wise exploratory analysis

Descriptive statistical evaluation

Comparative analysis across categorical variables

Visualization‑driven insight generation

Interpretation of results from a market and business perspective

Tools & Technologies

Python – Core programming language for analysis

Pandas – Data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation

NumPy – Numerical and statistical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Professional‑grade data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive environment for analysis and reporting

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of structured records representing used vehicles available in the market. Key attributes include:

Vehicle brand and model

Year of manufacture

Fuel type and transmission

Mileage and performance indicators

Ownership history

Market selling price

This dataset enables multi‑dimensional analysis of factors affecting vehicle resale value.

Key Insights & Findings

Vehicle price shows a consistent decline with increasing age and mileage

Brand reputation has a significant impact on resale valuation

Diesel vehicles generally demonstrate stronger price retention compared to other fuel types

Ownership history plays a crucial role, with first‑owner vehicles dominating higher price segments

Clear pricing variation exists across fuel type, ownership category, and vehicle age

Deliverables

Cleaned and structured dataset

Exploratory data analysis notebooks

Insight‑driven visualizations

Well‑documented analytical conclusions
